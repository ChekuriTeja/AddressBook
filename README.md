An Address Book project in C is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage a list of contacts. The main features of this project typically include adding, viewing, searching, editing, and deleting contacts. Below is a brief description of each feature:

### 1. **Add Contact:**
   - The user can input details like name, phone number, email, and address.
   - The new contact is saved into a file or an array, depending on how the project is structured.
   - The program checks for duplicate entries to avoid redundant data.

### 2. **View Contacts:**
   - This feature allows the user to view all the contacts stored in the address book.
   - Contacts are usually displayed in a formatted list showing details like name, phone number, etc.
   - Sorting functionality may also be implemented to display contacts alphabetically or by other criteria.

### 3. **Search Contacts:**
   - Users can search for a specific contact by name, phone number, or other criteria.
   - The program retrieves and displays the matching contact(s) from the address book.

### 4. **Edit Contact:**
   - This feature enables users to modify the details of an existing contact.
   - The user selects a contact to edit and then updates the necessary fields.
   - The modified contact is saved back to the file or array.

### 5. **Delete Contact:**
   - Users can remove a contact from the address book.
   - The program deletes the selected contact and updates the file or array to reflect the changes.

### 6. **Save and Load Contacts:**
   - Contacts are typically stored in a file (like a text or binary file) to persist data between sessions.
   - The program loads the contacts from the file when it starts and saves any changes when the program exits or when requested by the user.

### 7. **User Interface:**
   - The interface is usually text-based, using menus for different operations (e.g., Add, View, Search, Edit, Delete, Exit).
   - Error handling is implemented to manage incorrect inputs or operations.
